# Ens
### Why?
Creating a new programming language is probably one of the most stupid and useless things you can do right now.

The truth is that I think that a plain English programming language leads to syntax error and misunderstanding and that most of the strongly typed programming languages lead to unnecessary, complicated overhead.

Once we get to the point when we need to decide "how" and "how", and maybe "how" we could write our new, shiny, (native) project we might ask ourselves questions like:
**Can I please NOT use C/C++?** (If that's not the case, and C is your preferred programming language, Ens' aim is to bring an easier experience overall)

**Coming from a world of non-native programming languages like Java, JavaScript, Python**, I would ask that question to myself many times.
Cool programming languages that compile to native code exist, but **I don't like them**.

It is probably just a matter of opinions, and you might think that my opinion is just plain wrong.
We could discuss that all day long, but **there are syntax features that I like from some languages and syntax rules that I hate from others**.

### Goals
**Ens**' objective is to **code** using **likable**, **readable**, **syntax rules**. And I hope it'll be able to do just that.
Also, we're trying to leave pointers out for now.

### Coding standards
Ens has an official coding standard, you're free to choose another one of your likings.
